    Database Configuration:
        By default, Django uses SQLite. If this is sufficient for your blog, no action is needed. However, for learning purposes, you can configure it to use PostgreSQL or another database by adjusting the DATABASES setting in settings.py.

Step 3: Define Blog Models

    Model Specifications:
        Create a model Post in blog/models.py with the following fields:
        title: models.CharField(max_length=200)
        content: models.TextField()
        published_date: models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        author: models.ForeignKey to Django’s User model, with a relation to handle multiple posts by a single author.
        Run the migrations to create the model in the database: bash python manage.py makemigrations blog python manage.py migrate

Step 4: Set Up Static and Template Directories

    Static Files and Templates:
        Create directories for static files and templates within the blog app.
        Place the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into the appropriate directories. Ensure that Django is configured to find these files by setting STATIC_URL and TEMPLATES in settings.py.

Step 5: Launch the Development Server

    Initial Testing:
        Start the Django development server to ensure everything is set up correctly: bash python manage.py runserver
        Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the initial setup.
